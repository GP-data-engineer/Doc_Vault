| **EU Directive**           | **2006/42/EC** – *Machinery Directive* (with amendment 2019/1020)                                                                       | Act of 13 December 2006 – **“Regulation of the Minister of Industry and Trade on general safety and health protection provisions for work related to the operation of machines”** (Journal of Laws 2007 No. 86, item 587) | **Machinery Directive** – 2006/42/EC (in force throughout the EU)                                  |
| **Essential requirements** | Articles 3–10 of the directive set out the essential requirements for the design, construction, and conformity assessment of machinery. | The same requirements are reflected in the Polish regulation and in PN‑EN standards.                                                                                                                                      | Harmonised European (EN) and international (ISO) standards adopted as “presumption of conformity.” |

## 2. Risk Assessment Methods – Key Standards

| Standard | Number and title (EN) | Polish equivalent (PN‑EN) | Scope / short description |
|----------|-----------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| **EN ISO 12100** | *Safety of machinery – General principles for design – Risk assessment and risk reduction* | **PN‑EN ISO 12100** – *Safety of machinery – General principles for design – Risk assessment and risk reduction* | Defines the risk assessment process (hazard identification, risk estimation, selection of protective measures). |
| **EN 60204‑1** | *Electrical equipment of machines – Part 1: General requirements* | **PN‑EN 60204‑1** – *Electrical equipment of machines – Part 1: General requirements* | Concerns the safety of electrical installations in machinery; includes guidelines for risk analysis related to electrical energy. |
| **EN ISO 13849‑1** | *Safety‑related parts of control systems – Part 1: General principles for design* | **PN‑EN ISO 13849‑1** – *Safety‑related parts of control systems – Part 1: General principles for design* | Specifies methodology for risk assessment in the context of control systems (performance categories, failure analysis). |
| **EN 14971** (for medical devices, but often cited in machinery risk assessment) | *Medical devices – Application of risk management to medical devices* | **PN‑EN 14971** – *Medical devices – Application of risk management* | Provides a universal risk management framework (identification, assessment, control, monitoring). |
| **EN ISO 14121‑1** (older version, replaced by ISO 12100) | *Risk assessment – Part 1: Principles* | **PN‑EN ISO 14121‑1** – *Risk assessment – Part 1: Principles* | Historical basis for ISO 12100; still found in some documentation. |

## 3. How to Conduct a Risk Assessment According to EN ISO 12100

1. **Hazard identification**  
   - Functional analysis of the machine (block diagram, flow diagrams).  
   - Use of methods such as *HAZOP*, *FMEA*, or *What‑If*.

2. **Risk estimation**  
   - Determining the **probability** of an event occurring and its **consequences** (injuries, material damage).  
   - A risk matrix (e.g., 5 × 5) helps classify the risk level (low, medium, high).

3. **Selection of risk reduction measures**  
   - **Elimination measures** (e.g., design changes, separation of hazardous parts).  
   - **Protective measures** (guards, barriers, emergency stop switches).  
   - **Informative measures** (signage, safety instructions).

4. **Verification and validation**  
   - Functional and measurement tests confirming the effectiveness of the applied measures.  
   - Documentation of results and updating the risk assessment when design changes occur.

5. **Post‑implementation monitoring**  
   - Incident log, periodic reviews, documentation updates in accordance with **ISO 45001** (occupational health and safety management).
